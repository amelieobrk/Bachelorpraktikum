# Altklausuren-Lernportal für den FB Medizin der Goethe Uni

This repository contains the source code for the "Altklausuren-Lernportal", a learning portal for medical students at the Goethe University, developed to assist with exam preparation by providing access to past exam questions.

## Project Overview

The project involves the complete redevelopment of the existing "Kreuzen" platform, enhancing its usability, maintainability, and performance using modern web technologies.

### Technologies

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Spring Framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **API Documentation**: Swagger for RESTful API documentation

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories:

- `kreuzen-frontend/`: Contains all frontend code, built with React and TypeScript.
- `kreuzen-backend/`: Contains all backend code, built with the Spring Framework.


### Getting Started

To get the portal running locally, you need to set up both the backend and frontend environments.

#### Prerequisites

- Java 11 or higher for the backend
- Node.js and npm for the frontend
- PostgreSQL as the database
